    <p>
    The field of data science stands at an inflection point, and there could be many different directions in which the future of data science research could unfold. Accordingly, there is a growing interest to ensure that current and future data science research is used in a responsible manner for the benefit of humanity (i.e., for social good). To achieve this goal, a wide range of perspectives and contributions are needed, spanning the full spectrum from fundamental research to sustained deployments in the real world. This workshop will explore how data science research can contribute to solving challenging problems faced by current-day societies. For example, what role can data science research play in promoting health, sustainable development, and infrastructure security? How can data science initiatives be used to achieve consensus among a set of negotiating self-interested entities (e.g., finding resolutions to trade talks between countries)? To address such questions, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners across different strands of data science research and a wide range of important real-world application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore future work directions, and create collaboration opportunities. In addition, the workshop will emphasize highlighting data science approaches for tackling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

    <p>
        Our workshop’s target audience consists of (i) data science and machine learning researchers who have used (or are currently using) their ML research to solve important real-world problems for society’s benefit in a measurable manner; (ii) interdisciplinary researchers combining data science research with various disciplines (e.g., social science and psychology); and (iii) engineers and scientists from organizations who aim for social good, and look to build real-world systems using data science techniques.
